  class User
    # Users have a name.
    # Users have an amount of credits.
    # A new user has originally 100 credit.

    # A user can add a new item to the system with a name and a price; the item is originally inactive.
    # A user can buy active items of another user (inactive items can't be bought).
    # When a user buys an item, it becomes the owner; credit are transferred accordingly;
    # immediately after the trade, the item is inactive. The transaction fails if the buyer has not enough credits.
    # A user provides a method that lists his/her active items to sell.
